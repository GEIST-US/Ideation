# GEIST: An Artist and Customer Owned Record Label

**Abstract.**
A purely tokenized music recording label would allow for artists and customers to share 
equity in the project and contribute to its development in novel ways. Fostering an intimate 
relationship between artists on the label and its consumers creates a lasting investment in 
the success of both parties. Firstly, we imagine a label that is like a one-time subscription 
service for digital music. The price of entry into the system is negligible. Once in the ecosystem, the artists 
on 
the label are able to airdrop, or directly send, music to the consumers. As NFTs allow for rapid, frictionless 
commerce, we rely on the consumers valuing the music as they see fit, while the label collects royalties from 
token sales. We propose a business structure 
where the revenue of the label is represented by a token. We enable the revenue of the token to be split amongst token 
holders in an automated, trustless fashion, paying both artists and loyal customers in the native currency of 
BitCoin. This allows for an environment where artists are greatly incentivized to provide their 
best work and contribute to the growth of the label, while customers are largely 
incentivized to do the same. Both reap the rewards of the label's continued growth.

## **I. Introduction:**

The recording industry has largely failed to adapt to the changing tides in the music business at large.
