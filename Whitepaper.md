**Abstract.**
GEIST is an artist and customer owned record label built on a tokenized structure. A 
purely tokenized music recording label would allow for artists and customers to share 
equity in the project and contribute to its development in novel ways. Fostering an intimate 
relationship between artists on the label and its consumers creates a lasting, mutual investment in 
the success of both parties. Firstly, we imagine a label that is like a one-time subscription 
service for digital music. The price of entry into the system is negligible or inoffensive and in return the 
customer receives a tokenized membership. Once in the 
ecosystem, the artists 
on 
the label are able to airdrop, or directly send, tokenized music to the consumers. As NFTs allow for rapid, 
frictionless 
commerce, we rely on the consumers valuing the music as they see fit, while the label collects royalties from 
token sales. This effectively turns our 'club members' into distributors and entrepreneurs for our digital music 
tokens. Secondly, we propose 
a business structure 
where the revenue of the label is represented by a fungible token, here called GSTC. We enable the revenue of 
the label to be split amongst token 
holders in an automated, trustless fashion, paying both artists and loyal customers in the native currency of 
BitCoin. This allows for an environment where artists are greatly incentivized to provide their 
best work and contribute to the growth of the label, while customers are largely 
incentivized to do the same. Both reap the rewards of the label's continued growth.

## **I. Introduction**

The recording industry has largely failed to adapt to the changing tides in the music business at large. In the 
past, before recording, music was a largely live and localized affair. Since the invention of the recording 
industry, distribution has become a lucrative business, leading to several decades of an increasingly globalized 
music 
industry. However, now the internet has completely demolished the need for large, monopolized structures to 
distribute music to the world. As a result, music labels and industry structures have relied instead on 
bureaucratic hierarchies, verbose and usurious contracts, and social media algorithms to maintain relevance in a 
rapidly changing business. This results in a top-down, pyramid-like structure for music, where very few musicians 
are 
able 
to make a living and homogeneity is encouraged. Despite many musicians creating small, dedicated fanbases in the 
new internet paradigm, they are unable to monetize this without playing the games set by the suits.

We seek to alter this paradigm by using the distributive powers of the internet to reach a global audience, while 
using a business structure that more closely emulates needing a small, localized fanbase to support us. It is the 
opinion 
of this author that an artist only needs one thousand dedicated fans to have a modest, middle-class income that 
can support their work. Though we can see traces of this being true in the world today, with services such as 
Patreon or Twitch leading the way towards an intimate relationship between creator and consumer, we are looking 
to take this one giant leap further. 

## **II. Artists**

The bedrock for a music label is its artists. An ideal relationship between an artist and a label would be such 
that the artist is willing and likely to continue releasing on the label because there are great benefits to 
doing so. 

To foster this sort of relationship, we propose paying the artist in the GSTC token.
