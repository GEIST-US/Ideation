_Here I will post ideas for future product development of the label:_

- A collectibles page on https://geist.live that showcases all GEIST products as well as those a user owns [WIP]
- A token enabled site to download a GEIST CLUB sourced sample pack []
- A page on https://geist.live that includes all of our Youtube videos fetched from the @geist.us Youtube channel []
- An airdropper tool
- An IRC chatbox with embedded superchats and reaction emotes for live shows on https://geist.live

_Have an idea? Please make a Github issue and it will be added to this list_
